# 001 - Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. (An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.)

## Examples

- Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
  Output: true

- Input: s = "rat", t = "car" 
  Output: false

## Constraints

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104  
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters
