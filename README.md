# LeetCode Solutions in Python & TypeScript

Welcome to my algorithm vault.

This repository is a curated collection of solutions to selected LeetCode problems, implemented in **two languages**:
- 🐍 Python: for its expressive, clean syntax and AI-friendly ecosystem.
- 🧩 TypeScript: my go-to for scalable frontend/backend apps.

---

## Why this project exists

Solving algorithms in two languages is more than just repetition. It's about:
- Thinking across paradigms
- Becoming language-agnostic
- Writing cleaner, more versatile code
- Building a strong foundation for technical interviews and beyond

Whether you’re preparing for FAANG interviews, brushing up DSA, or just curious — welcome aboard.

## Problem Format

Each problem includes:
- A markdown file with explanation and thoughts
- A Python solution
- A TypeScript solution (sometimes JS fallback)
